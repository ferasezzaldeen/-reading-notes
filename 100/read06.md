Color can really bring your pages to life. so its very importent to have them in your website

in CSS we have a lot of ways to call colors :
* 1-rgb values

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

* 2-hex codes

These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

* 3-color names

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan


*CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
