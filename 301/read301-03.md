### definition:
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

### map()
the map() function to take an array of variable and then do the a certin process to each of its element and return a array with the same size 

### list and keys
we can make the lists in the JSX with the same way as the JS 
and we should now that each list should have a key

## ***the Spread Operator***

### definition:

The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.


### What is it used for ??
1. The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments.
2. Copying an array
3. Concatenating or combining arrays
4. Using Math functions
5. Using an array as arguments

### exaples
1- combine two arrays.
```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

2- add a new item to an array.
```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

```

3- Combining objects
```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

```

## ***How to Pass Functions Between Components***

first of all you should make the function in the parent component

you can pass the function from the parent to the child in the same way as any other element.
and the child can invoke it by using 
```
this.prop.methodName();
```
