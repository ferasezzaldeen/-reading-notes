## definition 
 Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers(not only on the browser) In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime using chrome's V8 engine

 the chrome V8 engine is an engine that could compile the js code into a language that the machine can learn.


 ## node.js in your own machine

 You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v.
 for me I have v12.21.0

 ## npm in your own machine
 
 You can check that npm is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing npm -v.
 for me I have 7.16.0

 ## Installing a Package Globally
 you can install package called ‘jshint’by opening the terminal and typing

 npm install -g jshint


 ## What Is Node.js Used For?
 installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

 These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
