# ***Putting it all together***


## ***Thinking in React***

One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.

### ***building a searchable product data table using React.***

### 1-Start With A Mock
1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names

2. Build A Static Version in React

The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.

3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

4. Identify Where Your State Should Live

we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. 

5. Add Inverse Data Flow

Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.
