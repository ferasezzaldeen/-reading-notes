## Who is Roy Fielding?

He is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.






## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?




Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?


 HTTP is capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

 ## What does a GET do?


 it can be used to order the machine to bring somthing on the internet by its URL.

 ## What does a POST do?

 it is used when one system needs to add something to another system.

 ## What does PUT do?

 it is used when one system wants to replace something in another system.

 ## What does PATCH do?

 it is used when one system wants to do partioal update onanother system.
