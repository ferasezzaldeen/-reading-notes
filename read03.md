HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

```
<head>
here we can write information that will not appear to the user but will be very importent to the search engines for examples
<head>
<body>
here you can put any thing you want it to be showen in the website 
<body>

```
the body tag can be devided for a lot of parts but often it been devided for three main part 
* the header
* the main
* the footer
