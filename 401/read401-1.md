in this course I shoul be okay with pain 
we will have a ot of it 
all kind of pain 
but...
I will end up with a great knowledge.


## ***Big O Notation***

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario

1. O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

2. O(N)

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.


3. O(N²)

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 


4. O(2^N)

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

5. Logarithms
