# ***Linked Lists***
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## tyypes of linked lists:
1. Singly:

 Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

2. Doubly:

 Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous


## definetions:

Node : Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next : Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head : The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current : he Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

## Traversal
When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.


The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. If we accidentally end up trying to traverse on a node that is null, a NullReferenceException gets thrown and our program will crash/end.


When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.


### Traversal Big O
The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.


## Adding a Node
Order of operations is extremely important when it comes to working with a Linked List. What I mean by this is you must be careful that all references to each link/node is properly assigned.

An example can be with adding a node to a linked list. If we want to add a node with an O(1) efficiency, we have to replace the current Head of the linked list with the new node, without losing the reference to the next node in the list.

Here are the required steps to add a new node with an O(1) efficiency.

1. he values passed in as arguments into the Add() method will define what the value of the Node will be.
2. newNode.Next by default is set to null. We want to set newNode.Next property to the same location that the Head node is pointing towards.
3. We now have to re-assign where Head is pointing too. Since Node1 is no longer the first node in the list, we want to re-assign Head to point at newNode.


Adding a Node O(n)

1. Let’s start out with a basic Singly Linked List:
2. We will set the value of node6 to be 16. The Next will be null because we haven’t yet attached it into the linked list.
3. We can do an AddBefore method or an AddAfter. For this documentation, we will do an AddBefore. The AddAfter is extremely similar…see if you can figure it out on your own!



## Print Out Nodes
Printing out all of the nodes in a Linked List is very similar to what we did in the Includes() method. This is because we are leveraging our Current node and a while loop to traverse through the existing linked list.

* O(1) function:
takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm.

* O(n) function
s linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.

* O(n²) function
akes exponentially more time and memory the more elements that you have. It’s pretty safe to say that we want to avoid O(n²) algorithms, just from looking at that crazy red line!
