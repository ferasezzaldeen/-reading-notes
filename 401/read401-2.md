# ***Testing and Modules***

## ***In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python***

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

### Important aspects about the unit test
1. The tests can be considered as your alive documentation. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing.
2. The test file name should follow the same name of module name.

### AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
* Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);

* Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);

* Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.


### The Cycle

The cycle is made by three steps:

1. üÜò Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
2. ‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
3. üîµ Refactor the code ‚Äî the first version doesn‚Äôt need to be the beautiful one (don‚Äôt be shy)

## ***If name equals main***
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special ```__name__``` variable to have a value ```‚Äú__main__‚Äù```. If this file is being imported from another module, `__name__` will be set to the module‚Äôs name. Module‚Äôs name is available as value to `__name__` global variable. 


Advantages : 

1. Every Python module has it‚Äôs `__name__` defined and if this is `‚Äò__main__‚Äô`, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.

2. If you import this script as a module in another script, the` __name__` is set to the name of the script/module.

3. Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
4. if `__name__` == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.


## ***Recursion***

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.



### How a particular problem is solved using recursion? 
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion.   

### Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion? 
If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. because in some cases the base step is not reachalbe and for that the memory will be exhausted and it will cause a stack overflow error. 


### What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion? 
if the function was called by the same function is called direct and if the recursion was called by another function it will be an indirect recursion

### What is difference between tailed and non-tailed recursion? 
A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.
