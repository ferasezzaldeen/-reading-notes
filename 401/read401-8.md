# ***List Comprehensions***
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists, It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.


The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.


## Syntax
The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’, square brackets, to help you remember that the
result is going to be a list.

```
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
```


## Examples


### Create a simple list

```
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x

# This will give the output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```


### Create a list using loops and list comprehension
```
# You can either use loops:
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
 
print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

```
### Multiplying parts of a list

```
list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
 
print multiplied 
[9,12,15]
```

### Show the first letter of each word
```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
```


### Using list comprehension in functions

```
>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
```
