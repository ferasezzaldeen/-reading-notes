# ***Introductory HTML and JavaScript***

## ***1-structure***

here we are going to talk about the HTML language which is like the skaleton for the web page,
we have alot of versions for the HTML but here we are gona talk about the HTNL5.

the HTML page is consist of 2 parts, the head and the body 
and can be write down as below 
```
<html>
  <head>
  <head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
    the page. And if the page is a long one it might
    be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
    you follow the structure of what is being written.
    There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
     headings).</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
you can write codes in  HTML using somthing calls tags 
and every tag can do a deferent thing 
for example 
```
<p></p>:
``` 
to wtite a paragraph
```
<h1></h1>
```
to make heading and you can change the number from 1 to 6 based on the importence 1 is the highest and 6 is the lowest

in general, the tags are consist of 2 parts, the open tag and the closing tag:

## ***2-extra markup***

every element in the html can be givin a name that will help to identify it from other elements, and that can be done by something called attribute like the following:
### ID attribute 
```
<p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel
a calming sense of security, as if visiting my
ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
</p>
```
### class attribute 
```
<p class="important">For a one-year period from
November 2010, the Marugame Genichiro-Inokuma
Museum of Contemporary Art (MIMOCA) will host a
cycle of four Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibitions.</p>
```
### classification of element
now about the element of the HTML, they can be classified into 2 types, 
* 1-block elements: which are the element that always appear in a new line 
* 2-inline element: which are the element that can be appear in the middle of a line after another element.

### iframe
you can use the iframe to have anew window inside your window to show another website 
```
<iframe
width="450"
height="350"
src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york
&amp;output=embed">
</iframe>
```
### meta
the meta element can be preformed in the head elemnt. and it can store information about the owner of the website or the designer or a description of the page. but the information in the meta will not be visable for the user of the website.

## escape characters
some charactars are reserved by html code and cant be shown to the user in if you need to show him or her the symbol (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)

and to solve that problem you can use what is called "escape characters" that will refer to the reserved symbol

## ***3-HTML layout***

### header and footer
we use them to make a space to show some importent information about the website. the header will appear in the top of the page and the footer will appear in the bottom of the page.
```
<header>
<h1>Yoko's Kitchen</h1>
<nav>
<ul>
<li><a href="" class="current">home</a></li>
<li><a href="">classes</a></li>
<li><a href="">catering</a></li>
<li><a href="">about</a></li>
<li><a href="">contact</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
</header>

<footer>
&copy; 2011 Yoko's Kitchen
</footer>
```
### navigation
The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.
```
<nav>
<ul>
<li><a href="" class="current">home</a></li>
<li><a href="">classes</a></li>
<li><a href="">catering</a></li>
<li><a href="">about</a></li>
<li><a href="">contact</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
```
### Sections
The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
```
<section class="popular-recipes">
<h2>Popular Recipes</h2>
<a href="">Yakitori (grilled chicken)</a>
<a href="">Tsukune (minced chicken patties)</a>
<a href="">Okonomiyaki (savory pancakes)</a>
<a href="">Mizutaki (chicken stew)</a>
</section>
```
## ***4-processand design***
first of all, when you want to design anew web page, you have to collect some importent info about it. this info can be collected by answering the folloing question:
* 1- Who is the Site For?
* 2- Why People Visit Your Website?
* 3- What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
* 4-What Information Your Visitors Need?
* 5-How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site?

after that you will start to organize your thoughts by making a ***site maps***

the next step is to do a ***WireFrames***,and the wirefram is asketchof the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require 

![hh](https://d1dlalugb0z2hd.cloudfront.net/handbooks/agile-handbook/wireframe/01-youtube-wireframe-example.png)

the next step is to ***Getting your message
across using design*** and that include 
* content
* Prioritizing
* Organizing
* visual hierarchy
* Grouping
* Similarity


you can also ***Design Navigation*** in a proper way because Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
