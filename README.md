by reviewing the first article I can say that its talking about the text editors, simplify them and mintion some of the most famous ones. but what I liked about it. is that shows you how much they are close to each others. and the final and the most importent factor for the programmer to choose one of them is his own satisfing about it. he outher mintioned something about the extintions and how importent are they, but I thing that I will keep my opinion until I start coding and find what is importent and what is not.


the following article talks about the terminal and how to deal with it. for a person like me who is new to the coding thinsg I find it very hard to work with and I prefair the GUI 
but when the instructor start making command in the terminal , it showed me how it makes things easier 
in the thired article the outher start giving examples about the  commands that you can use in the terminal like:  ls -> which is used to list all the files in the folder ,cd-> which is used to change the directory of the files pwd-> which stands for Print Working Directory
here are some examples made by me 
user$ mkdir ferreas
user$ cd ferreas
ferreas$ cd used
ferreas$ cd..
cd..: command not found
ferreas$ cd ..
user$ rm ferreas
rm: cannot remove 'ferreas': Is a directory
user$ rm -R ferreas
user$


the last article talks about the aspacts of files in linux. I can summerize it with the following: first, the linux does not worl=k with extinsion like other operation system. it can know the type of the file by opening it. the other thing is the space in linux which is conidered as a end for the world and should take note about this spicially whin we work with names of files. we could solve this problem using \ or ''
