 ## ***Basic usage of canvas***
 ![dcdcd](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*1d6oMjjsNM4QrprjTxb87w.png)
 At first sight a canvas looks like the img element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the canvas element has only two attributes, width and height.

 he id attribute isn't specific to the canvas    element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element 

 ### Fallback content
 The canvas element differs from an img tag in that, like for video, audio, or picture elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers.

 ### Required `</canvas>` tag
 As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, unlike the img element, the canvas element requires the closing tag (`</canvas>`).


 ## ***Drawing shapes with canvas***

 we should know that canvas can only drow rectangules and paths and from them it can drow the following

1. rectangles
2. pathes
3. triangle
4. lines

and more


## ***Applying styles and colors***

### Colors
there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

#### fillStyle :
```
ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
ctx.fillStyle = '#FFA500';
```

#### strokeStyle:
```
 ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgb(0, ' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ')';
```
### Transparency
his is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.
globalAlpha = transparencyValue
Applies the specified transparency value to all future shapes drawn on the canvas. The value must be between 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). This value is 1.0 (fully opaque) by default.
```
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)';
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)';
```
### Line styles
There are several properties which allow us to style lines:

1. lineWidth = value
2. lineCap = type
3. lineJoin = type
4. miterLimit = value
5. getLineDash()
6. setLineDash(segments)

### Shadows

Using shadows involves just four properties:
1. shadowOffsetX = float
2. shadowOffsetY = float
3. shadowBlur = float
4. shadowColor = color



## ***Drawing text***
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

1- 
```
fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
```
2- 
```
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
```


### Styling text

1. font = value
2. textAlign = value
3. textBaseline = value
4. direction = value
