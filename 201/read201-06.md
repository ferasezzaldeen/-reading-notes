# ***JS Object Literals; The DOM***

## ***OBJECT***
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

* the variables are called properities in object
* the functions are called methods in object


we can define a variable by the following:

```
var object name ={

    //here you can have the orioerities and the method
    name: 'name',
    nuymber: 0,
    methodName: function(){}
}
```
we can access any properities or methods using the . as following:
```
var objectname.name;

```
and to assign :
```
var objectname=properitiename['name'];
```


## ***Documents Object Model "DOM"***

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser windowS

IT covers two main areas :
* MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE
* ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE

### The DOM tree 
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.

types of Nodes:
* document node
* element node 
* attribute nodes
* text nodes

### ACCESS THE ELEMENTS
we have 3 ways to reach the element in the DOM tree 
* SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT NODE
* SELECT MULTIPLE ELEMENTS
* TRAVERSING BETWEEN ELEMENT NODES

### WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS
* ACCESS/ UPDATE TEXT NODES
* WORK WITH HTML CONTENT
* ACCESS OR UPDATE ATTRIBUTE VALUES


#### caching dom queries
we can access and edit the elements by a lot of commands and ways and for examples :


```
getELementById('one');
getElementByld('id');
querySelector('css selector')
getElementsByClassName('class')
getElementsByTagName('tagName')
querySelectorAll ('css selector')

```

## ***Understanding The Problem Domain***

![dvdvd](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wgHEeHTjowA/maxresdefault.jpg)
 It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.
  understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation.and you can do that with 2 ways :

  + Make the problem domain easier:

  by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem. I mean by this is that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.
  + Get better at understanding the problem domain:
  
  It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.  Best to resist the temptation to “not waste anymore time talking” and make sure you understand a problem inside and out before you try and solve it with code.  It is much more expensive and time consuming to do things over than it is to do them right the first time.
