# ***HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions***

## ***Domain Modeling***

s the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

### how to build a comain model :

+ build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
+ Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
+ Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
+ Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
+ Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
+ Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

## ***Tables***


![fvfvf](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/static/a8b2dc7adbdc8df1e0748154b813471f/c1b63/html-table-javascript%402x.png
)

A table represents information in a grid format.

### we can make a simple table in js using the following tags:
```
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>45</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>45</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>90</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

### Table Headings
we can make a heading in the table using th tags.
```
<tr>
<th scope="row">Tickets sold:</th>
<td>120</td>
<td>135</td>
</tr>
```
### Spanning ColumnS
we can make a spanning columns
```
<td colspan="2">Geography</td>
```
### Spanning Rows
```
<td rowspan="2">Movie</td>
```

### Long Tables
 to make a long table using a nother structural tags,thead,tbody and tfoot
```
<table>
<thead>
</thead>

<table>
<tbody>
</tbody>
<tfoot>
</tfoot>
```

## ***Object-Oriented Programming***

### constructor object 
we can use the constructor object if we have a lot of similer objects need to be defined.
```
function Hotel (name, rooms, booked) {
this .name = name;
this.rooms = rooms;
this.booked = booked;
this.checkAvailability = function()
return this.rooms - this.booked;
} ;
}
```
we can edit and add properties like following :
```
hotel .gym = t rue;
hotel .pool = fal se;
delete hotel .booked;
```
### THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)
we can use the THIS to call propereties and method inside the object as following :
```
var width= this . innerWidth;
var height = this .innerHeight;
```

### BUILT-IN OBJECTS
we have 3 types of built-in object:
* BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
* DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL 
* GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

#### BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
![fddc](https://wordpresscom57404.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/bom.jpg)
The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser.

some example of the browser object model:
```
window.nnerHeight
window.innerWidth
window.pageXOffset
window. pageYOffset
window.screenX
window.screenY
window.location
window.document
window.a1ert ()
window.open ()
window.print()
```
#### DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
![dvvf](https://devopedia.org/images/article/282/2000.1595439379.jpg)
The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current browser window or tab. You meet its child objects in Chapter 5.
```
document.title
document.lastModified
document.URL
document.domain
document.write()
document.getElementByld()
document.createElement()
```
#### GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS
![dcdcd](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-global-object/banner.png)
Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value.
```
saying.length;
saying.toUpperCase();
saying.tolowerCase();
saying.charAt(12);
saying.lastlndexOf('e');

```
