# ***HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions***

## ***HTML Links***

### Writing Links
we can link external web pages or pages from the same website or even part from the same page using a tag as following :

```
<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>
<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
```


### Relative URLs

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website, and you will see their types below.

- Same Folder
```
<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>
```
- Child Folder
```
<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>
```
- Parent Folder
```
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>
```


### Email links 
we can link email by using the attribute ```mailto```
in the following way.
```
<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>
```
this attribute will start up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address.


### Opening Links in a New Window
we can use the attribute ```target``` to make this as the following way
```
<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">
```



## ***CSS Layout***

### Building Blocks
we should know that css treats every html elemnt as if it is in its own box, and theis boxes have 2 types :

- Block-level elements: which start on a new line 

for example :
```
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
```

- Inline elements: which flow in between
surrounding text

for example:
```
<img> <b> <i>
```


### Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

### Controll ing the Position of Elements

CSS has the following positioning schemes:

#### Normal flow
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside,
they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).


#### Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.

#### Absolute positioning
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.

#### Fixed Positioning
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.

#### Floating Elements
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.

##  ***JS Functions***


![rtrtds](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*dAwQkc-E0j1AcpdPeGznzg.png)
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function .

### function declaration
we can declar a function by one of two ways:
```
function area (width, height){
return width * height;
};

```
or
```
var ar ea = f unction(width, height) {
r eturn width * height;
} ;
```
### function calling
we can call the function by writing the function name and enter any input it needs like following:
```
var size= area(3, 4) ;
```



## ***Pair Programming***
it can be defined as two people works together on the same code,one of them is an employee with high experience and the other is with less experience. of course 2 more hand is better. but here the other two hand will work as a navegator for the first ones.

Pair Programming has a lot of good impact on the work, for example:

* Greater efficiency
* Engaged collaboration
* Learning from fellow students
* Social skills
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness
