# ***HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow***

## ***HTML Lists***
html offers 3 types of lists in it 

![hjhjjkgf](https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HTML-LISTS.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)

### Ordered lists 
are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

and we can make the ordered list by using the ol tag and li tags inside it 
```
<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
```
### Unordered lists 
are lists that begin with a bullet point

and we can make a unordered list by usng ul tag and li tags inside it 
```
<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
```
### Definition lists
 are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

we can make the difinition lists by dl tag and inside it dt tags for the terms that going to be defined and dd tags for the difinitions
```
<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>
```


## ***CSS Boxes***

### box dimention 
we can use the width and height properties to change the size of the box
```
div.box {
height: 300px;
width: 300px;
}
```
* and also we can use the min or max width or depth
to insure that the box will upper in perfect shape with deferent size screen
* we can use **overflow** to control how the box content will look if its bigger then the box, we can use hidden to hide the extra content or use scrol to put scrol arownd the box 

### border, margin and padding

![ccc](https://sabe.io/classes/css/css-box-model-padding-border-margin/css-box-model.png)

The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.
* the border is like the line between the margin and the padding we can edit it using border-width, border-style, border-color and much more 
* for the padding and the margin we can edit them like following 
```
p.example {
padding: 10px;}

p.example {
margin: 20px;}
```
and also we can define which side to edit like this 
```
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
```

### centering content
we can center any thing using one of two ways, text-alighnment and margin-auto
```
body {
text-align: center;}
p.example {
margin: 10px auto 10px auto;
text-align: left;}
```


### ***JS Control Flow***


### Arrays
we can use the arrays to store more than one value inside the variable.
and that can be done as following
```
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];
```
note that ```color[0]``` will give you the first value 

```color[1]```will give you the second value

### SWITCH STATEMENTS
we can use the switch if we have more then 2 possibility
and it takess the following form :
```
switch (level) {
case 'O ne ':
title= 'Level 1 ' ;
break;
case 'Two':
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;
break;
case ' Three' :
title = 'Level 3' ;
break ;
default :
title= 'Test';
break;
}
```


## ***Loops***
 ![fff](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/JavaScript-Loops.jpg)
the loops has a condition at first the condition is checked,if its true, the block inside the loop will be run. at the end the condition will be checked again and so on until the condition gives you an false output.

we mainly have 3 types of loops 

* 1-For loop

and it used when you want to run a code for spicific number of times and it has the following form:
```
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```
* 2-while loop 
it is uesed when you dont know how many times the code will run. an it has the following form 
```
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```
* 3-do while loop 
its the same as the while loop but it the code inside the block has to be run at least one time even if the condition gives you false from the start. and it has the following form:
```
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
```
