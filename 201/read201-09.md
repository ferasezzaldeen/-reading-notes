### Form Controls
* ADDING TEXT: like Text input or Password input
* Making Choices: like Radio buttons and Checkboxes
* Submitting Forms: like Submit buttons and Image buttons
* Uploading Files: like File upload

### how to thsy work 
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects.
3. The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.
4. The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.
### Form Structure
```
<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
method="get">
<p>This is where the form controls will appear.
</p>

## ***HTML Lists***
html offers 3 types of lists in it 

![hjhjjkgf](https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HTML-LISTS.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)

### Ordered lists 
are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

and we can make the ordered list by using the ol tag and li tags inside it 
```
<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
```
### Unordered lists 
are lists that begin with a bullet point

and we can make a unordered list by usng ul tag and li tags inside it 
```
<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
```
### Definition lists
 are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

we can make the difinition lists by dl tag and inside it dt tags for the terms that going to be defined and dd tags for the difinitions
```
<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>
```
## ***constructor object***
we can use the constructor object if we have a lot of similer objects need to be defined.
```
function Hotel (name, rooms, booked) {
this .name = name;
this.rooms = rooms;
this.booked = booked;
this.checkAvailability = function()
return this.rooms - this.booked;
} ;
}
```
we can edit and add properties like following :
```
hotel .gym = t rue;
hotel .pool = fal se;
delete hotel .booked;
```
### THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)
we can use the THIS to call propereties and method inside the object as following :
```
var width= this . innerWidth;
var height = this .innerHeight;
```

### BUILT-IN OBJECTS
we have 3 types of built-in object:
* BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
* DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL 
* GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

#### BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
![fddc](https://wordpresscom57404.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/bom.jpg)
The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser.

some example of the browser object model:
```
window.nnerHeight
window.innerWidth
window.pageXOffset
window. pageYOffset
window.screenX
window.screenY
window.location
window.document
window.a1ert ()
window.open ()
window.print()
```
#### DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
![dvvf](https://devopedia.org/images/article/282/2000.1595439379.jpg)
The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current browser window or tab. You meet its child objects in Chapter 5.
```
document.title
document.lastModified
document.URL
document.domain
document.write()
document.getElementByld()
document.createElement()
```
#### GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS
![dcdcd](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-global-object/banner.png)
Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value.
```
saying.length;
saying.toUpperCase();
saying.tolowerCase();
saying.charAt(12);
saying.lastlndexOf('e');

```
