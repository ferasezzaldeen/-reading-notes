## ORDER OF EXECUTION
when you have experience with trailing and following the code step by step will help you figure where the error is
and will make you when and where to write the code .


## EXECUTION CONTEXT
we have 3 types of execution context 
1. GLOBAL CONTEXT

Code that is in the script, but not in a function.
There is only one global context in any page.

2. FUNCTION CONTEXT

Code that is being run within a function.
Each function has its own function context.

3. EVAL CONTEXT

Text is executed like code in an internal function
called eval()

### VARIABLE SCOPE

![ddcvd](https://miro.medium.com/max/1416/1*e-A-jDYmBTIfN2ADj13iaw.png)
GLOBAL SCOPE: If a variable is declared outside a function, it can
be used anywhere because it has global scope.
If you do not use the var keyword when creating
a variable, it is placed in global scope.

FUNCTION-LEVEL SCOPE: When a variable is declared within a function,
it can only be used within that function. This is
because it has function-level scope.

##
when a new execution context is to be run ,it will wa;l through 2 steps :
    
1.  prepair
2. execute

## ERROR OBJECTS
![dsvsd](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-errors/banner.png)
thay can help you to know what type of error did you have

for example :

1. Error: general erro
2. Syntax Error: Syntax has not been followed
3. ReferenceError:Tried to reference a variable that is
not declared/within scope
4. TypeError: An unexpected data type that
cannot be coerced
5. Range Error: Numbers not in acceptable range
6. URI Error:encodeURI ().decodeURI(),and
similar methods used incorrectly
7. Eval Error: eva l () function used incorrectly


## HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS
you can do one of two things:

1. DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
2. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY
