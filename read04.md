the javaScript is a language that can make the wep page more interactive with the user of the web site. we can make slideshows, forms, inputs and more using it. 

but to use the javascript you need to have some information about the prosses of coding and it call can be done by the script

### ***the script***

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

you can summerize the making of script steps into 3 steps:
* defining the the goal
* sesign the script
* code each step 


## ***Expression***
An expression evaluates into a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 

we have two main types of expression
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 

* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
```
color = 'beige'; 
```
* COMPARISON OPERATORS
```
buy = 3 > 5; 
```
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
```
area = 3 * 2;
```
* STRING OPERATORS
```
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly'; 
```
* LOGICAL OPERATORS
```
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 
```

## ***The Function***

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function

we have a lot of function types and for example 
* basic function
* declaring function
* calling function
* declaring function that need information
* calling function that need information
