# ***Local Storage***
The local storage is a type of HTML5 offline storage that allows user string data to be saved synchronously in their browser. Information is kept in name and value pairs and not available between different browsers on the same device.

## ***In History*** 

 For native applications, the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention. If your native client application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions.

 and at first, cookies ware used to store data locally but thay had some problem like :
 * Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
 * Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
 * Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

 ## ***A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5***

 to over come these problem some hacks have been done such:
  1.  DHTML Behaviors
  2. Flash cookies.
  3.  dojox.storage.

  ## ***INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE***
  it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you.

### some command to use in local storage 

to access the local storage :
```
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```

Calling setItem():
```
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
```

getItem():
```
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
```
removeItem()
```
interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
```


clear()
```
interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
```
